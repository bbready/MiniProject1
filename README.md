Project calculating updated true shooting % coefficient for basketball and baseball OPS and WHIP predictions based on various priors

The first part of the project contains ways of calculating and updated true shooting percentage coefficient, different from the traditional 0.44 based on 2018-2021 season.

After this, the goal of the project was to predict a player's end of season OPS and WHIP based on their games through the end of May with various priors. Stein estimators were used here for the calculations, which were done using the overall average for OPS and WHIP for all player's during 2016-2018, player specific averages from those seasons, and then prediction that the players average would remain the same for the rest of the season. Details for calculations are in the markdown document, and the completed report can be found in the PDF.
